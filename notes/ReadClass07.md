# **REST**


## Who is Roy Fielding?

-He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does.

## Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

-Because they weren't designed to be used like that.

## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

-This protocol is all about applying verbs to nouns. Like when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

## What does a GET do?
