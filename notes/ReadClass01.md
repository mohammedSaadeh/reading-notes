# **Readings: Introduction to React and Components.**

React is a JavaScript library, ts aim is to allow developers to easily create fast user interfaces for websites and applications alike.

## What is a component?

a component is a JavaScript class or function that optionally accepts inputs and returns a React element that describes how a section of the User Interface should appear.

## What are the characteristics of a "component"?

1-Reusability:

-It measures how easily the component can be reused in a new environment.

2-Replaceable:

-It can be replaced with other components that are similar to it.

3-Not context specific:

-Components can work in other domains.

4-Extensible.

5-Encapsulated:

-React provides a declarative library that keeps the DOM in sync with your data.

6-Independent:

-Almost no dependance on other components.

## What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

1-Ease of deployment:

-It is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

2-Reduced cost:

-The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

3-Ease of development:

-It allows development without affecting the other parts.

4-Reusable:

-It can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

5-Modification of technical complexity:

-Modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.

6-Reliability:

-Each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.

7-System maintenance and evolution:

-Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

8-Independent:

-Independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.

## What is Props and How to Use it in React?

-Props are arguments passed into React components. Props are passed to components via HTML attributes. props stands for properties.

## How are props used in React?

-We use props in React to pass data from one component to another (from a parent component to a child component(s)).

## What is the flow of props?

-React, a Javascript library, uses unidirectional data flow. The data from the parent is known as props. You can only transfer data from parent to child and not vice versa. This means that the child components cannot update or modify the data on their own, makeing sure that a clean data flow architecture is followed.
